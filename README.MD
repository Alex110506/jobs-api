# Jobster API

This is a small full-stack web application for tracking job applications.
The project was based on a frontend ReactJs course on which I implemented backend functionality using NodeJs + Express and MongoDB tied with Mongoose for additional features. The scope of the project was to improve my backend knowledge, get familiarized with best practices and try to implement a clean and well-structured codebase.
